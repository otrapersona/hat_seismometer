## starter.py is a ramshackle daemon for hat_dog.py, then it is started with the sense hat's middle button and stopped with any other one.

## the service starts starter.py, don't forget to check file locations

I checked and the sense hat won't obstruct the pins. diagram https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-GPIO-Circuits-Using-an-LDR-Analogue-S/
